            <p>SnapBack App. to Download and install Skype legacy version 6.18.80.106 </p>
			<p><b> Advice If Downgrading:</b><br><br>

If you downgrade your Skype version, this will likely be temporary. I predict that all updates will become forced very soon, as they've stated that all auto-updates will mandatory with Windows 10. This also will mean they will permanently break any previous versions of Skype. As of today, March 31, 2015, Skype is now upgraded automatically through Windows update, KB2876229. Your only option for disabling this is to right click in Windows Update, and choose HIDE. But, even this may be temporary, since a future update may “unhide” that KB, or issue a new one, just as they did with the Windows 8.0-8.1 forced upgrade. This will still not disable updates from being requested inside versions 6.18-6.22, for which you must also turn off the “Skype update service.”</p>

			<p>All SnapBack Apps are free for both business and personal use, provided that the SnapBack Platform is "hand installed", by a user and not "mass installed".    However, for some apps they may be working with or modify another application, such as Microsoft Word, which is obviously not free.  Sometimes we might independently offer that application to you with a link to a separate page.  If and when we offer you the software, we warrant that to our best ability, we've fully disclosed which products in that category are best, the least cost prices with links, along with any dissenting opinions from contributors like you. </p>

Together, this page, the FAQ, and the discussions of users, contributors, and CDP should convince you that this project is worthy of your full support.</p>

<p><strong>There's a number of ways you can help our contributors, the SnapBack Platform Project, and users like you:</strong></p>
  
<p><strong>Tell us:</strong><br>
       - Changes of how our Apps should look or work, and we'll quickly make those changes.<br>
       - When software or hardware frustrates you, let us try to help:  <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Browse the index on the left to see if there is already a solution, since more will be added daily.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- When your solution or frustration is not listed, since once we hear you, we'll quickly create those solutions.<br>
 </p>
<p><strong>Tell others:</strong><br>
      - Show how a SnapBack App is a solution to an asked question on sites like SuperUser.com.  Many sites offer written solutions that advise, if you hand-type or apply the fix.  Often, the solutions published vary in quality, method, have no error handling, and require more context and understanding than most users have. By simply referring them to that specific App's page, users on that site can simply choose to and safely apply that fix with a single click, (or first install SnapBack).  Read "best practices" and "example answers" to a posted problem, using links to a specific SnapBack App page.  
</p> 
<p><strong>Buy from us, or from our affiliate links:</strong>   (Note:  All sales will be done by Columbia Data Products, publisher of SnapBack Apps)<br>
       - We don't pepper you with ads you don't want to see, or suggest any products that our contributors don't think you need to see right then. You'll be happy if you consider our contributor's recommendations when you see them, since we guarantee the best independent advice and price, along with any of the best alternatives known.<br>
       - Amazon Affiliate links -- Anything you buy when you use this link helps us provide more solutions  [@SMadara: put affiliate link here, with graphic]<br>
       - Microsoft Products --  Contact us, and we'll either provide the best prices on your needs, or advise you who has the best prices.  [Contact us HERE]<br>
       - Google Apps and other Google products and services  CDP is already a dealer for Google, and we will provide you the best prices  [Contact us HERE]<br>
 </p>
<p><strong>Contribute CASH to SnapBack Apps: </strong>  (( ALL of these options should go to ONE page, with much more specific directions @SMadara))<br>
       - Amazon Payments [ need to verify link for donations ]<br>
       - BitCoins (Get logo, and I will get you an address)<br>
       - Cash  [provide a link or email address]<br>
       - PayPal --- <br>

      		<p><strong>The SnapBack Apps Factory is a platform where</strong> regular users interact with, or become App contributors and developers themselves.  Most technology products initially frustrates users unnecessarily.  If new versions were produced daily, users and developers were constantly communicating, products would quickly evolve to work perfectly.  SnapBack Apps' mission is to modify how any existing hardware and software interacts with ordinary users.   Our Factory connects users, contributors and developers in near real time to create or improve SnapBack Apps.  Changes that are apparently required are quickly communicated, applied and deployed to all users within hours.  Eventually, all changes that any user would ever want, are created and deployed.  The SnapBack Apps Factory platform is where contributors and users of all kinds communicate, design, and ultimately work together to accomplish this mission..</p>
